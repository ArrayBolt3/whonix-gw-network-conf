  * Pointing /etc/resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1.
  * Whether a Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateway supports system DNS for its
 own traffic in the clear or anonymized mainly depends on the Gateway's
 firewall.
  * Routing the workstation's system DNS through the anonymizer (also known as
 Transparent DNS Proxy) or not is up to the Gateway's firewall as well.
